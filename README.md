# SoapUI-first-project 

## General info
This is my first project which I have crated on my own in Soap UI. The purpose of this was to learn in practical knowledge which I gained from some course.
I also wanted to know some other tool for API testing besides Postman.
## Project
So in XML file there are endpoints for this REST [API](https://gorest.co.in/), in JSON format. It contains some endpoints for CRUD endpoints for users
and also some GET and POST endpoints for creating posts/comments/todo lists for a particular user.
In project there are also some Test scenarios with test cases which invent on my own. I used basic assertions for responses, but also
wrote some assertions in groovy for messages in responses and also for data returned in responses (if they are correct etc.). I used properties and setup and tear down scripts.
I also created some logs which are available in script logs in Saop UI.
This project of course doesn't cover all tests which can be conducted on this API. I did it just for training.
